One aspect is the curiosity of who gets what, but the other is that for a lot of problems they have this 'NP Complete' nature to them, where coming up with a solution is significantly harder than verifying a candidate solution. So your best performance will come from just asking all the models, and then getting them to come to a consensus."*
